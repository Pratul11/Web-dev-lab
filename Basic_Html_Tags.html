    <p>This is a paragraph tag HTML 5 One of the most important technologies on this list doesn't fully exist yet HTML 5 but in 2008, key features started to trickle out. HTML 5 will eventually replace HTML 4.01, the dominant programming language currently used to build web pages. But the governing bodies in charge of the web are still drafting the details, and nobody expects HTML 5 to fully emerge as the new standard for at least a few more years. But HTML 5 is no vaporware. Many of the changes to the way the web operates as outlined in early versions of the new specification are already being implemented in the latest browsers, and some of the web's more adventurous site builders are already incorporating HTML 5's magic into their pages. HTML 5 will be great step forward, standardizing things like dragging and dropping elements on web pages, in-line editing of text and images on sites and new ways of drawing animations. There's also support for audio and video playback without plug-ins, a boon for usability and a worrisome sign for Adobe's Flash, Microsoft's Silverlight and Apple's QuickTime</p>
